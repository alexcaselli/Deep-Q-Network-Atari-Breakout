# Deep Q-Network for reinforcement learning with TensorFlow and OpenAI Gym
The purpose of this project is to train a Deep Q-Network agent (https://daiwk.github.io/assets/dqn.pdf) using the OpenAI Gym environment (https://gym.openai.com/) to play the famous Atari game BreakOut.
The DQN agent has 3 main components: the online Q-network, the target Q-network, and a replay buffer.

A demo video of the DQN agent playing can be found here as Gameplay.mp4
